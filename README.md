After years of self-study into data science, and by utilizing as many online learning platforms for my skills development, I finally decided it was about time I transferred this knowledge to every person out there. I have a YouTube channel where I teach these skills and you can choose to subscribe [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElijahAppiah). I am an economist by profession and it is obvious that economics (and econometrics for that matter) coincides with data science in many respects. The following are topics/lessons I will be making videos on:

1. Master R Programming
2. Master Python
3. Statistical Inference with R
4. Statistical Inference with Python
5. Econometrics with R
6. Econometrics with Python
7. Machine Learning with R
8. Machine Learning with Python
9. Time Series Analysis with R
10. Time Series Analysis with Python
11. Deep Learning with R
12. Deep Learning with Python
13. Master Stata Software
14. Master Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
15. Statistical Inference with SPSS
16. Statistical Inference with Stata
17. Time Series Analysis with EViews
18. Spatial Analysis with R
19. Spatial Analysis with Python
20. Principal Components Methods in R (PCA, CA, MCA, FAMD, etcâ€¦)
21. Principal Components Methods in Python
22. Exploratory Data Analysis with R
23. Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
24. Master Structured Query Language (SQL)

The list is non-exhaustive and more will be added with time. You can feel free to suggest any other relevant topics that I can cover. **ALL LESSONS ARE FREE** AND WILL BE POSTED ON MY [YOUTUBE CHANNEL](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElijahAppiah) ONE STEP AT A TIME. You may decide to donate to help this initiative (how you can do so will be communicated later, but in the meantime, ENJOY!). It is my aim to make the channel one of the best platforms to disseminate knowledge for free. I can guarantee that the lessons will thoroughly planned, comprehensive and detailed, systematic, practical and right-on-point.

I am also contemplating on what name is suitable for this initiative. In the meantime, I refer to it as **TECHNOMICS DATA SCHOOL** (but my channel is named after me. ðŸ˜œ)
